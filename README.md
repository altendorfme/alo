Al√¥ is a tool for managing and registering Web Push notifications. It also provides features for campaign management, analytics, and user segmentation.

Al√¥ is the open source alternative to OneSignal, PushNews, SendPulse, PushAlert, and others.

## Installation with Docker üê≥

Install [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

`curl -o ./docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altendorfme/alo/main/docker-compose.yml`

`curl -o ./.env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altendorfme/alo/main/docker.env.example`

Edit environment:

`nano .env`

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| TZ | UTC | Timezone for the application |
| WORKERS | 1 | Each worker is a push service, each worker sends 5-6 pushes per second. Increasing the number of workers will directly impact database usage. |
| AMQP_USER | Empty | Username for AMQP message broker authentication |
| AMQP_PASS | Empty | Password for AMQP message broker authentication |
| AMQP_VHOST | alo | Virtual host for AMQP to isolate applications |
| MYSQL_DATABASE | alo | Name of the MySQL database for alo |
| MYSQL_USER | alo | Username for MySQL database authentication |
| MYSQL_PASSWORD | Empty | Password for MySQL database authentication |

**AMQP**: RabbitMQ is used by default, but LavinMQ has also been tested and works correctly.

Now just run `docker compose up -d`

## First-Time Setup üîß

## Al√¥ SDK üì±

You'll need the alo Client SDK on all your pages:

```javascript
import aloClient from 'https://alo-server.xyz/clientSDK';
```

Just drop this in, and you're ready to roll! The SDK gets set up with different options depending on what you want to do with it.

### Automatic Subscription ‚ö°

This option will show the permission prompt after a short delay - no user clicks needed!

```javascript
const aloConfig = {
    customSegments: {
        tag: 'tag-teste-auto',
        category: 'cat-teste-auto'
    },
    registrationMode: 'auto',  // ‚Üê Magic happens here!
    registrationDelay: 3000,   // Just 3 seconds wait
    enableLogging: true,
    onRegistrationSuccess: () => {
        alert('Push notification registration successful!');
    },
    onRegistrationError: (error) => {
        alert('Registration failed: ' + error.message);
    }
};
const aloClient = new aloClient(aloConfig);
```

The secret sauce here is `registrationMode: 'auto'` - this tells alo to automatically ask for permission. You can control how long to wait with the `registrationDelay` setting.

### Manual Subscription üëÜ

Prefer to let users decide when to subscribe? This approach requires a click before asking for permission.

```javascript
const aloConfig = {
    customSegments: {
        tag: 'tag-test-manual',
        category: 'cat-test-manual'
    },
    registrationMode: 'manual',  // ‚Üê User control!
    enableLogging: true
};
const aloClient = new aloClient(aloConfig);

subscribeBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        await aloClient.subscribe();
        alert('Push notification subscription successful!');
        subscribeBtn.disabled = true;
    } catch (error) {
        alert('Subscription failed: ' + error.message);
    }
});
```

With `registrationMode: 'manual'`, alo waits patiently until you call `subscribe()`. Perfect for adding to a "Subscribe" button!

### Unsubscription üëã

Sometimes users want to say goodbye to notifications. Here's how to let them unsubscribe:

```javascript
const aloConfig = {
    customSegments: {
        tag: 'tag-test-unsubscribe',
        category: 'cat-test-unsubscribe'
    },
    enableLogging: true
};

const aloClient = new aloClient(aloConfig);

unsubscribeBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        await aloClient.unsubscribe();
        alert('Push notification unsubscription successful!');
        unsubscribeBtn.disabled = true;
    } catch (error) {
        alert('Unsubscription failed:' + error.message);
    }
});
```

Just hook up an "Unsubscribe" button to the `unsubscribe()` method, and you're good to go!

### ü§ñ Service Worker

Your notifications need a Service Worker to function even when users aren't on your site:

```javascript
importScripts('https://alo-server.xyz/serviceWorker');
```

Just put this in your `aloSW.js` file, and alo handles all the background notification magic for you! ‚ú®
